This is a password generator that uses a dictionary file which contains every english word in the dictionary to generate the user a password. 
The user will enter the desired length of the random password as an integer into the CustomTkinter GUI.
The program will then randomly select a word from the dictionary of the inputted length. 
The program will also randomly insert special characters and numbers to make the password more complex.
Once a pasword has been generated, the user will be prompted to save the password if they like it. 
The user can also regenerate a password if they do not desire to save the password that has just been created for them. 
Saved passwords are saved to a json file located in the same directory as the python main.py file.
